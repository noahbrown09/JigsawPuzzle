I wasn't able to get around to packing this into a .JAR file before my time in the class ended, so this must be ran via any IDE. I used JGrasp because it was required for the course, and there are detailed instructions for installing it and the requisite Java Development Kit here: 
- https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/
Once that has been installed, open the included JigsawPuzzle.gpj file inside the "src" folder with JGrasp. Just click run (the icon of the running man) and the program should open after a few seconds. This wait time is necessary for the image manipulation steps.

This project only functions on Java version 8 update 202 and lower. No, I don't know why.
